Steps to get up and running:
- have NodeJs installed (I am using v6.9.1 at the moment)
- clone this repository (HTTPS)
- navigate to the root of the repository and run the command "npm install" without the quotes (I used Windows's Command Prompt with administrative privileges)
- start the application using the command "npm start"

    The application should now be up and running at https://localhost:4242
